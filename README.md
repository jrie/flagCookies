# FlagCookies

A cookie, and browser storage manager with cow powers.
Gives the ability to flag and set rules explicitly for cookies, also third-party cookies, cross origin, and secure cookies aswell as browser storage management and clearing.

![main_interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6949cda-8092-441d-be0b-7dec94d925ee)

**Domain.net** and **subdomain.Domain.net** can have individual rights. Providing several modes to set rules on cookies and keeping a cookie profile, while being logged in in a website or service.

## Important privacy notice
- No cookie information besides the name and domain name are stored inside FlagCookies to work, no values, no direct details.
- No session data or details are stored or processed
- No history of visited domains or websies or any other tracking is used.

### Before you use this addon
This add-on is mainly aimed at power users, this might sound harsh, but it is realy not!

To get the most out of FlagCookies, you define cookie rules for websites or make use of `Global Flag`, or `Auto flag`, `Profile` modes.
In case you use payment services/providers, disable the "Global flag" feature temporarily. For example when using Paypal or other shopping/payment services or providers.

### *Long story made short* - Basic usage
1) Use `Global mode` if you are surfing, this will remove all kind of cookies while browsing the web if not protected by `profile` mode.
2) Use `Auto flag` which will remove all cookies for one website/domain - this can be useful if you only want to automatically remove these page cookies every time you browse this website.
3) Use `Profile mode` either globally for a website, protecting all cookies of that domain if no cookies are picked as profile cookies. Or protect single cookies even when `Global flag` or `Auto flag` modes are active.
4) `Click / Flag` and set rules for each cookie individually, works together with the other modes.

## Requirements

A recent version of possibly any **Chrome** browser, **Firefox**, **Opera**, **Edge** or **Brave** browser(s).
Please note, there is no mobile version of FlagCookies.

## Some features

**FlagCookies distinguishes between http(s)://domain.net and http(s)://subdomain.domain.net** for the following features:

* Detects and displays stored browser cookies, storage data, and be able to manage (flag) and delete those while browsing, either automatically through ***global*** or ***auto flag*** mode or by explicit decision
* **Flag cookies** either to be explicitly **deleted** even without *global* or *auto flag* mode or set them to be **permitted** or protected from removal by *global* or *auto flag* modes
* **Profile** mode for a domain or cookies - to switch between *logged into a website/service* and *not logged in* modes in order to remove or keep cookies on demand

## Translations
As of version 3.0.27 translations can be done of Flag Cookies.

FlagCookies is also now translateable on  [Transifex at the flagCookies project page](https://app.transifex.com/dwroxnet/flagcookies).

### For direct translation
All translations are located inside **\_locales/** folder - and the folders **en** for general English, as well as **de** for German language. Inside every folder is a **messages.json** located. This file holds all translations for the interface.
To create a new language, for example French, use **fr** as code. So it ends up to everything French language related inside **\_locales/fr/messages.json**. To add another layer of help copy the **help.html** from the **en** directory to **fr/help.html** - when everything is done, the changes will be visible when reloading the addon.
